# Quick N Dirty OID Scraper (QNDOS)

Would you believe me if I told you there was no publicly available, machine-readable database of IETF OID's?  
  
Well there isn't that I could find.  This was a project to scrape the (now defunct) site oidref.com (a reference of all oids, accessable as html pages and navigable through links).
